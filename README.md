# Project Overview: 
Due to shipping delays and stockouts, inventory management inefficiency leads to profit loss, missed sales opportunities, and reduced customer satisfaction. Having the right amount of inventory is critical to improving business operations. DataCo Global, a multinational company distributing clothes, sports equipment, and electrical supplies, provides an example of how data can solve stockout issues.

# Business Problem:
The causes of stockouts and poor inventory management are related to poor-performing suppliers, inefficient demand forecasting, fewer workers, natural disasters, and fluctuating customer demands. These factors cause significant challenges in maintaining optimal inventory levels. 

Organizations like Amazon have addressed these problems by successfully implementing machine learning tools to optimize inventory levels and reduce stock. However, most companies and data scientists have approached solving these problems mathematically, not levering deep reinforcement learning. Deep reinforcement learning models thrive in complex environments, are adaptive decision-makers, and can learn from real-time data, which makes these models suitable for solving complex problems like inventory management. 

# Research Objective:

Our capstone project focuses on optimizing inventory efficiency. Our goal is to mitigate stockouts, and we will do this by using the data of the company DataCo. We will also use advanced statistical concepts like Deep Reinforcement Learning to tackle this problem.

# Research Questions:
Q1) What associations can be made to increase profits or reduce costs?

Q2) Forecasting inventory demand to reduce stockout. 

Q3) Prediction of shipping duration based on different variables
